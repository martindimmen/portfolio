# Martin Dimmen's Portfolio

Welcome to the GitHub repository of my personal portfolio website. This project showcases my skills and projects as a Software Engineer and Web Developer.

## About the Project

This portfolio website is built using React and Vite, offering a minimal yet efficient setup. It includes several components that represent different sections of the website, such as an introduction, a portfolio showcase, a timeline, contact information, and a footer.
